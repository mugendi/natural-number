# An advanced entity extractor for numbers, units and dates

This module is used to:
- parse numbers, units, dates in a string
- extract parsed numbers, units & dates
- expand parsed numbers, units, dates

Usage is pretty easy, simply give it a string to crunch...


```javascript

var natN=require('natural-number');

var natural_number=new natN({ lang:'en' })

var string= 'there are two hundred and fifty two cowna and fourteen goats. Negative twenty 4. She was the fifty second patient. What! Ksh1000! He was ranked 2nd. King Mwati LVIII is dead! And then there is 5GB of data on that hard drive. Are you 78% sure? TestDasherize&Decamelization. Last September there was a goat on the door. She needs 3 pints of blood urgently! President Moi was born in 5th january one thousand nine hundred and ninety four and will be forty four years old next week. Can you finish two liters of milk? :-) :\') :\'( . Wait he didnt call me that. IKR NKT ';

natural_number.parse(string,false,function(parsed){
	console.log(JSON.stringify(parsed,0,4))
})

```

Output:

```json
